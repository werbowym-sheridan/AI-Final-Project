its very cool

The project focuses on predicting the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores using machine learning models applied to the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset. The PyCaret library was utilized to streamline model comparison and selection. Various baseline regression models were evaluated to identify the best-performing algorithm. The selected model was further refined, and its performance was analyzed using metrics like residual plots, error plots, and feature importance visualizations. The model's accuracy was measured using the RÂ² score, achieving a performance of approximately 0.97, indicating robust predictive capability. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of automated machine learning frameworks in developing accurate and interpretable models for healthcare data applications.
